# NonAdaptiveKofN

NewDriver is the driver program; it generates random costs and probabilites for a given n and k.
Then it calls NewAllPermutations to find the optimal non-adaptive strategy and its cost for the function, and it calls NewAdaptiveAlg to find the optimal adaptive algorithm and its cost.

Variable is used to store variable name, ci and pi.
Node is used to build the tree for both adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms.
